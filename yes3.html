    <h1>FOR YOU</h1>
    <p>Hi, I just want to say that i like you, its a very cliche saying but i think it means a lot.
        We have been friends for a long time and there is no doubt about it. You are just a person that i really appreciate a lot.
        If i were given another shot to show how much i like you, i would take it, even if it means that i would have to wait for a long time.
        Though i may not be good with words, i hope that you would understand how much i like you, these words are just to hard to define. </p>
    <p1> I like everything about you, in fact words are not enough to explain to the world how much i like you.
         I like your eyes, your smile, your laugh, your voice, your personality, your caring nature, your kindness.
         Even your silly side. What im trying to say is that even if you think have imperfections, in my eyes you are like an artwork that is full of perfection.
         I know this might seem much but all i wanted to say is that i like you....
    </p1>
